## Assignment 1
For assignment 1, we used pandas to explore PLUTO data downloaded as zipped csv files. We compared land use in Manhattan and Brooklyn.  
We mainly worked on this assignment independently, but reviewed each other's code for help when stuck on certain tasks.  

## Assignment 2
For assignment 2, we used SQL calls to query a CitiBike database through CARTO. We selected by various, increasingly complex constraints and output the data as pandas dataframes.  
Again, we mainly worked on this assignment independently, and reviewed and borrowed code from each other as needed.
