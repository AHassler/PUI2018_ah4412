# Summary and Assignment 1 Screenshots
I worked on my own for HW3 (though I hope to collaborate more in the future as I get to know my classmates better). 

For Assignment 1, I created a csv locally and on GitHub, and then I deleted it on both, including its full history. This was practice for needing to fully delete sensitive data that accidentally made its way onto GitHub. 

For Assignment 2, I made a jupyter notebook, in which I downloaded a csv dataset from NYC Open Data, read it into the notebook using pandas, examined it by rendering tables, reducted it to two numeric columns, and finally created a scatterplot from those columns, complete with proper labels and captions.

For Assignment 3, I first obtained an API key from MTA via filling out a form and receiving the key by email.
