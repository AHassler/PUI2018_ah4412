## Assignment 1: Rendering a plot
In this assignment, we created a plot from urban data, keeping in mind data visualization best practices. The reproducible code to rendered the plot is stored in Assignment1_ah4412.ipynb within this directory. Below is a copy of the plot with a caption.

**Figure 1:** The plot above shows New York City per capita water consumption by year from 1979 to 2017. Though initially turbulent, the plot shows a general downward trend over time. This may reflect improvements in water efficiency, as well as conscious water conservation efforts.
