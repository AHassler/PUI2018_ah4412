# Initial Setup of the Environment

Last week we set up our environment from the commandline on the shell. First, we created a new directory. Then, we created an environmental variable to reference our PUI2018 directory. Then we made the change permanent by editing the .bashrc file to contain both the environmental variable and an alias to change to that directory. Now both the environmental variable and the alias exist in every new terminal we open. See images below.
