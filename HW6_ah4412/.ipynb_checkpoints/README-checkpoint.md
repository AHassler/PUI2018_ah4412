# HW6

**Team:** Andrea Hassler (ah4412), Jerome Louison (jl9489), Tiffany Patafio (tp1600)

## Assignment 1: Completed individually
In this assignment, we forked another student's repository containing their HW4 assignment on CitiBike data. We evaluated their hypotheses, their processing of the data, and suggested a test to use. Then we made a pull request to the original owner.

## Assignment 2: Completed by Jerome (jl9489) with corrections and additions made by Andrea (ah4412)
In this assignment, we searched for papers that used tests from 3 categories. We then documented the tests, variables, variables types, question answered, and H0 and alpha. We stored this information in the table below.



The following chart shows three different research papers taken from peer-reviewed journal PLOS ONE.

| **Statistical Analyses**	|  **IV(s)**  |  **IV type(s)** |  **DV(s)**  |  **DV type(s)**  |  **Control Var** | **Control Var type**  | **Question to be answered** | **_H0_** | **alpha** | **link to paper**| 
|:----------:|:----------|:------------|:-------------|:-------------|:------------|:------------- |:------------------|:----:|:-------:|:-------|
| Logistic Regression	| Height of tree cavity	| Continuous |	Presence of Leisler's bat (Nyctalus leisleri) |	Dichotomous |	N/A |	N/A	| What is the odds probability of Leisler's bat presence as tree cavity height changes? |	The ratio of occupied to non-occupied cavities is the same or decreases with a decrease in cavity height |	0.05	| https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/file?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0200742&type=printable
Correlation	| Sample of observed deposit withdrawals among peers	| Count	| Probability of bank withdrawal from depositor	| Ratio	| N/A |	N/A	| Does a decrease in the correlation between sample of withdrawals decrease the probability of a bank run? |	N/A |	N/A	| https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/file?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0147268&type=printable
ANOVA	| Level of Education*	| Ordinal	| Kessler Psychological Distress Scale	| Interval	| N/A	| N/A	| Bivariate relationship between demographic factors and feeling of psychological distress	| N/A	| N/A	| https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/file?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0202818&type=printable

*This was one of many demographic factors studied, including locality, sex, ethnicitiy, etc.)*


## Assignment 3: Jerome (jl9489) and Tiffany Patafio (tp1600) worked together equally on Assignment 3. Andrea (ah4412) reviewed.

In this assignment, we reproduced the analysis of the Hard to Employ program in NY. Specifically, we reproduced the results of testing the null for "Ever employed in a CEO transitional job" using a z-test and the results of testing the null of "Convicted of a felony" using a chi-square test.


## Assignment 4: Jerome (jl9489) started the assignment and then Andrea (ah4412) mainly worked alone to finish her copy.
In this assignment, we performed three tests on CitiBike data, comparing night riders with day riders. First, we processed the data to meet the needs of each test and produced relevant plots. Then, we conducted a KS test, Pearson's R, and Spearman's R.
