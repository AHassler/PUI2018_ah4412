| Logistic Regression	| Height of tree cavity	| Continuous |	Presence of Leisler's bat (Nyctalus leisleri) |	Dichotomous |	N/A |	N/A	| What is the odds probability of Leisler's bat presence as tree cavity height changes? |	The ratio of occupied to non-occupied cavities is the same or decreases with a decrease in cavity height |	0.05	| https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/file?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0200742&type=printable
Correlation	| Sample of observed deposit withdrawals among peers	| Count	| Probability of bank withdrawal from depositor	| Ratio	| N/A |	N/A	| Does a decrease in the correlation between sample of withdrawals decrease the probability of a bank run? |	N/A |	N/A	| https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/file?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0147268&type=printable
ANOVA	| Level of Education*	| Ordinal	| Kessler Psychological Distress Scale	| Interval	| N/A	| N/A	| Bivariate relationship between demographic factors and feeling of psychological distress	| N/A	| N/A	| https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/file?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0202818&type=printable
