# Homework 10
Group members: Andrea (ah4412), Tiffany (tp1600), Jerome (jl9489), and Fekade (fb1182)
Since we were all working on this simultaneously, we referenced each other's work whenever we got stuck and asked/answered each other's questions along the way.


## Assignment 1:
**Completed by Tiffany and reviewed/edited by Andrea. Jerome and Fekade completed their work independently for this assignment.**  

In this assignment, we finished what we started in lab. We compared linear and quadratic model fits on simple datasets, using an LR test to compare the models.


## Assignment 2:
**Tiffany completed the first half and Andrea reviewed/edited and then completed the second half. Jerome and Fekade started on their own and referenced second half to finish their versions.**

In this assignment, we looked at data from Manhattan on energy consumption and building sizes to asses the relationship between energy use and occupancy. We fit both linear and quadratic models and compared them using chi square statistics and an LR test.
