## Assignment 1: NYC Subways Part 2
In this assignment, we continued the subway time series analysis. This time we examined patterns in periodicity and identified the 4 stations with maximum periodicity.

Tiffany completed this assignment, working with another student to finish the second half, and I edited and reviewed afterwards.

## Assignment 2: Clustering
In this assignment, we looked at number of NYC business establishments from 1994-2014. We attempted to cluster NYC zipcodes by patterns in the number of establishments over time.

I worked alone on this assignment and shared it with the group for others to work off.
