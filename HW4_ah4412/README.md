# Homework 4
ah4412 I was unable to find a group again this week (schedules didn't align), so I worked on these on my 
own again.
### Assignment 1
In this assignment, we explored the Law of Large Numbers and the CLT by taking random samples of different 
distributions, calculating their means, and plotting the distribution of their means.
### Assignment 2
In this assignment, we came up with a question about CitiBike data, formulated a testable hypothesis, 
downloaded and cleaned the dataset, and explored a plot of the distribution.
### Assignment 3
In this assignment, we formulated a hypothesis about a fake dataset and then tested it using a Z-test.
